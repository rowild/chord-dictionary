## [2.0.3] - 2025-07-15

### Added
- **Error Modal System**: Implemented comprehensive error modal with red background
  - User-friendly error messages instead of console-only logging
  - Collapsible technical details section for debugging
  - GSAP animations consistent with existing modal system
  - Multiple close options (X button, OK button, click outside, escape key)
  - Integrated with chord processing, notation display, and audio playback errors
- **Global Modal Access**: Made modal globally accessible via `window.modal` for testing

### Improved
- **Robust Octave Parsing**: Replaced fragile string slicing with Tonal's `Note.octave()`
  - Handles double-digit octaves (e.g., "C10") correctly
  - Supports complex accidentals (e.g., "F##3")
  - More reliable than custom string manipulation
- **Howler.js Public API**: Replaced private `_sprite` property access with public API
  - Uses `sprite` property in Howler constructor for better maintainability
  - Generated sprites dynamically with `generateMidiSprites()` helper function
  - Future-proof implementation that won't break with Howler updates
- **CSS Class-based Filtering**: Replaced inline styles with Tailwind's `hidden` class
  - Better maintainability and consistency with utility-first approach
  - Improved performance with class manipulation vs inline styles
- **Modal Element Caching**: Extended DOM caching to modal system
  - Eliminated repeated DOM queries during modal interactions
  - Better performance for modal open/close operations
  - Consistent with existing caching patterns in the app

### Fixed
- **Modal Console Access**: Fixed modal not being accessible from browser console
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling throughout the application
  - Chord processing errors now show user-friendly modal
  - Notation display errors provide clear feedback
  - Audio playback errors inform users without breaking flow

## [2.0.2] - 2025-07-15

### Improved
- **Code Architecture**: Extracted clef selection logic into `determineClef()` helper function
  - Improved code clarity and maintainability in `drawNotes()` function

- **State Management**: Encapsulated global state within `app.state` object
  - Moved `selectedStartNote`, `selectedOctave`, `selectedChord` into `app.state`
  - Better organization and namespace management
- **Event Handling**: Improved event delegation with `e.target.matches('button')`
  - More robust than previous `tagName === 'DIV'` approach
  - Better accessibility and semantic targeting
- **Modal System**: Refactored modal setup to eliminate code duplication
  - Configuration-driven approach for easier maintenance
  - Generic `setupModal()` function handles all modal types
- **DOM Performance**: Implemented DOM element caching in `filterChords()`
  - Eliminates repeated DOM queries during filtering
  - Better performance for real-time search functionality
